# My dotfiles/config files
The install script will overwrite dotfiles/configuration files in the home directory. 

### How to install/setup:

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/BKM99/configs && cd configs
./install
```

NOTE: Restart terminal for changes to take effect. Also, when running nvim for the first time some of the installs may "fail" so just restart nvim and it should be fine. Lastly, the install script will overwrite files specified in install.conf.yaml
